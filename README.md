# Cards training

Here is an application that can help with any training.

For example, memorizing new words in English, technical terminology, irregular verbs. You make up questions on any topic and arrange them in a deck, one card - one question.
For figurative memorization - you can add a thematic picture to your question.
When you're learning, the app randomly shows you flashcards, you see a question, then you try to find the answer yourself and, if it doesn't work, open the back and check yourself.

You can share your cards with your friends, as well as learn from other people's cards.
